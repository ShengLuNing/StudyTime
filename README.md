# StudyTime
01/15/2022

A code repository for saving my study code and projects. Most of them are based on C# &amp; Javascript

Why I'm doing this:
Well, I usually write down my study notes, ideas and memo on a note app called 'Notion'. But sometimes I can not log in this app for network related issue or no reason. So today I finally made a decision about this backup plan on github. At least this proves that I'm not lazy, right?
